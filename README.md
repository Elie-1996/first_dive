# first_dive

A new Flutter project, which implements a simple Dice Roller Mobile Application.

This project is a learning experience for me to use Dart and Flutter. An elementary project to familiarize myself with the tools available for Dart and Flutter. 
At the time of this writing, I have been following through the course "Flutter and Dart - The Complete Guide [2023 Edition]". This marks the end of Section 2 of the course.

As I follow through this course, I will be making more projects with casual commits.

Feel free to look around.
